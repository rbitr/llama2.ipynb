It uses weights that were trained on a dataset of children's stories, so it only writes short children's stories. You can go to the link above to learn more about it.\n",

    "You can see example output above. This model has 15 Million paremeters (weights) so it is relatively simply but it still writes a coherent story by predicting next words. Models like GPT4 have hundreds of billions or trillions of parameters, which is why they appear so coherent and real. Architectually they are the same as this program, just scaled up to have a better model of the language."
